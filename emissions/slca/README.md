# Spatial life cycle assessment (SLCA) model framework #

This is a framework for creating spatially (and, if desired, chemical and temporally) detailed well-to-product life cycle inventories.

This model is also coupled to the [InMAP](http://inmap.spatialmodel.com) model Source-receptor Matrix to automatically calculate PM2.5 concentrations and health impacts caused by emissions of PM2.5 and its precursors.


### Installation ###

* Download the 2014 US National Emissions Inventory data as described [here](https://github.com/ctessum/aep/tree/master/data/nei2014).
* Install the [go compiler](http://golang.org/doc/install)
* Install the slca package ("go get github.com/spatialmodel/inmap/emissions/slca")
