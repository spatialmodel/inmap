## inmap

A reduced-form air quality model.

### Synopsis

InMAP is a reduced-form air quality model for fine particulate matter (PM2.5).
Use the subcommands specified below to access the model functionality.
Additional information is available at http://inmap.spatialmodel.com.

Refer to the subcommand documentation for configuration options and default settings.
Configuration can be changed by using a configuration file (and providing the

or by setting environment variables in the format 'INMAP_var' where 'var' is the
name of the variable to be set. Many configuration variables are additionally
allowed to contain environment variables within them.
