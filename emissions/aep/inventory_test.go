#DESC California nonroad CAP and HAP emissions, 2005v2
#DESC Originally created 4/1/2008  by CSC, WO79
#DESC CAP emissions (except NH3) came from annual data provided by Martin Johnson of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), mjohnson@arb.ca.gov  in  March 2007.
#DESC 2007. CAP emissions were created by applying a factor to the 2005 California ORL. Factors were developed by interpolating 2012 and 2020 emissions
#DESC  from CARB data.
#DESC NH3 is from 2015 NMIM runs for California.
#DESC HAP emissions were estimated by applying HAP-to-CAP ratios computed from Calif 2005 NEI submittal (2005 data provided by Laurel Driver 12/2007)
#DESC this was done because the Calif submittal from March 2007 did not include estimates for HAP
#DESC Retained only those HAP that are also estimated by NMIM for nonroad mobile sources; all other HAP dropped
#DESC Revised on 6/23/2010 by CSC to add in missing PM emissions for seven counties. Used the March 2007 version of the Calif 2005 inventory emissions

#REV_HISTORY 01/09/2009 Madeleine Strum.    What:  deleted more records    Why:  duplicates
#REV_HISTORY 01/09/2009 Madeleine Strum.    What:  removed records with fips=30777    Why:  invalid fips, point sources located in  northern Wyoming near Montana and  emissions not that large.
#REV_HISTORY 01/16/2009 Allan Beidler.      What:  fixed Lat/Lon coordinates for larger sources  Why: Didn't match the FIPS code
#REV_HISTORY 01/16/2009 Allan Beidler.      What:  Dropped sources located well in the ocean or lakes  Why: Outside of US
#REV_HISTORY v1(06/14/2010)  Madeleine Strum.   deleted all records associated with  both kilns - 1 and 2- from Atlanta LaFarge Cement Plant  Per Dan McCain, George DEP,unit 2 shut down in 2002 and the other unit in 2004 Dan: (404)362-2778.  Confrimed by SPPD project lead Elineth.  Grinding operations for this facility  remain in the NEI
#REV_HISTORY v1(06/14/2010)  Chris Allen.   Removed 175 duplicate records. See /orchid/share/em_v4/inputs/2005cr_05b/ptnonipm/work/2005ck_ptnonipm_cap_true_duplicates.csv for list; all records with year=2002 in that file were removed  These records were duplicates in that records from both 2002 and 2005 were in the inventory, but weren'tcaught before due to extra leading zeroes in the plant IDs, point IDs, etc for one year or the other
#REV_HISTORY v3(07/01/2010)  Madeleine Strum.   REmoved BlueRidge Paper - CantonMill records that were for year 2006 (none were state-submitted).  In this case:  Plantid= '3708700159' and (DATA_SOURCE = 'R' or year='2006')  these records double count state-reported emissions
#REV_HISTORY v3(07/08/2010)  Madeleine Strum.   Removed Unit 017 from Domtar Paper FIPS=47163, plantid='0022', and pointid = '017'  Email from James.R Smith, Division ofAir Pollution Control , state of Tennessee, 8July2010 confirmed:   Yes I did hear back from Domtar.  We had a conference call on yesterday evening.  They are re-submitting their form to us.  They stated that unit 017 is not operating.  It is being removed from the site but not all of it is gone completely.  They stated that they submitted a notice to EPA back in 2003 about the changes.  The unit was taken out of commission from operation sometime in 2002.
#REV_HISTORY v4(07/08/2010)  Madeleine Strum.   changed unit 039 of domtar paper "end date" back to 20021231  mistakenly changed unit 039 enddate to 2005 when I was changing unit 041 so I needed to change it back
#REV_HISTORY v3(07/01/2010)  Madeleine Strum.   removed unit B001from P. H. Glatfelter Company - Chillicothe  Facility (0671010028).  No other units were removed as theywere  confirmed to emit in 2008 by the Ohio EPA  (tom Velais)  EIS indicates that unit B001 shut down in 2002 and  OHIO  State contact (Tom Velais, "Tom Velalis" <tom.velalis@epa.state.oh.us>) confirmed it shut down mid 2002. email from Velais sent to Strum:  07/01/2010 03:06 PM
#REV_HISTORY v3(07/08/2010)  Madeleine Strum.   pointid 041, plantid = '420470005' which is DOMTAR PAPER and poll in ('SO2', 'NOX') so2 and nox to reflect 2005 data  provided by PA DEP in a fax details in reference  SO2 was from 2002 and did not reflect the fact that the boilers added scrubber so2002  emissions were overestimated
#REV_HISTORY v5(07/22/2010)  Madeleine Strum.   Removed perceived duplicate records- removed state submitted 2005 data and used the Industry-based 2006 data gathered by SPPD which was very similar in magnitude of emissions.  Chose to keep the SPPD data because it had all the pollutants present whereas state data had only a subset.  For the same unitid, stackid and SCC there were two records for the same polllutant with different data source codes but similar emissions values.  they appeared to be duplicates so they were removed.
