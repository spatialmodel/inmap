Changes made to GREET 2015 database to make it work here:

Process: Recovery of Shale Oil (Eagle Ford): Inputs and outputs of natural Gas form a loop, and the looped input (13817.3162 Btu) is larger than the looped output (13629 Btu). This causes an infinite loop. I've fixed this by changing the looped input to 13000 Btu and adding a new input of 817.3162 Btu from the "NA NG from Shale and Regular Recovery as Stationary Fuels" pathway.

Process: Recovery of Shale Oil (Bakken): Inputs and outputs of natural Gas form a loop, and the looped input (10553.2071 Btu) is larger than the looped output (10443.0000 Btu). This causes an infinite loop. I've fixed this by changing the looped input to 10000 Btu and adding a new input of 553.2071 Btu from the "NA NG from Shale and Regular Recovery as Stationary Fuels" pathway.

Replaced all "]]"'s in the database with "]"'s, because the extra "]"'s seem to be syntax errors.

Added NH3 emissions of 175.75 g/ton to "Ammonia (per ton of product) Production". NH3 emissions are estimated using national-level NH3 process emissions data from the National Emissions Inventory and national production data from the US Geological Survey (USGS) Mineral Commodity Surveys. Together, these allow us to estimate an industry emissions factor of ammonia per unit of fertilizer produced (presented in the lower section of the table below). NEI process emissions for all relevant Industrial Process � Chemical Manufacturing SCC codes were added to estimate an annual total NH3 emission rate for each type of N-fertilizer. N-fertilizer production rates were taken from the 2011 Minerals Yearbook, Nitrogen (http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/nitrogen/myb1-2011-nitro.pdf), specifically Tables 3 and 5.
