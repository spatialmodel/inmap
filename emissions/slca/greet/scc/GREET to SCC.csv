It is assumed to be composed (all percentages given by weight) of 12% molybdenum oxide (MoO2), 2% potassium oxide (K2O), 11% cobalt oxide (CoO), and 68% carbon support (activated carbon). The remaining weight is assumed to be sulfur from hydrogen sulfide, which displaces oxygen during chemical reduction of the surface. The catalyst is prepared by contacting activated carbon with a hot aqueous solution of soluble Mo salt (i.e., ammonium heptamolybdate) and cobalt nitrate [Co(NO3)2] in a phosphoric acidic solution. After drying, the solids are contacted with the caustic KOH solution and subsequently dried. The resulting catalyst is then sulfided (Stevens, 1989).",

The working-fluid also operates within a closed loop, but the energy transfer to the working fluid is via a heat exchanger, so I think it's an external combustion boiler (although is there really ""combustion"" in a geothermal plant?)",
