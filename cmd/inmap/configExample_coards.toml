# OutputVariables specifies which model variables should be included in the

# expression that can be used to calculate it
# (in the form VariableName = "Expression"). These expressions can utilize
# variables built into the model, user-defined variables, and functions.
# Available functions include:
# 'exp(x)' which applies the exponetional function e^x.
# 'log(x)' which applies the natural logarithm function log(e).
# 'log10(x)' which applies the base-10 logarithm function log10(e).
# Note: Environment variables can be used in both variable names and expressions.
